# Paint Strokes
Paint Strokes: The Open Source iOS/iPadOS theme

Paint Strokes UI and its elements will not be open source currently, this descision may change in the future though.

# Icon Requests
Don't see an icon in the theme or on our list to do? Create an issue on the repository!

Be sure to include the app name AND the app's Bundle ID. Your issue will be closed if it does not include thoses two.

Also, please limit your requests to a resonable amount of icons. If we find there are too many, we will pick the top 10 from the list

# Contributing
Looking to contribute? Awesome!

Firstly, we ask that you limit your canvas to 512x512 and make the icon relatively small so we can fit it into a Paint Stroke.

Contributing is as simple as three steps:

1. Fork it
2. Commit in your fork
3. Make a Pull Request here

Here you can find icons that still need to be designed:

- an app (with bundle id)

# Builds

All builds will be posted (hopefully) weekly at The Vibe repo.
